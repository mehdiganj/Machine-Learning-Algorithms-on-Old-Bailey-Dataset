# Machine Learning Algorithms on Old Bailey Dataset
Implementing Different Machine Learning Algorithms on Old Bailey Decisions Dataset - Machine Learning Course

In this project I implemented different classifiers to predict if the convicted person is guilty or not based on the transcript features and victim characteristic in the Old Bailey project.
I implemented perceptron (two submission), super vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, SVM over tree and neural network (using a library) for this task.
Based on the results, the performance of the algorithms is quite similar with the same dataset. In addition, the feature selection performs a key role in the classification task.



1. "1_Perceptron.piynb" jupytor notebook contains the perceotron implementation for 5 different datasets.
2. "2_SVM&LR.piynb" jupytor notebook contains the SVM and logistic regression implementation for misc. dataset.
3. "3_SVM_over_trees.piynb" jupytor notebook contains the SVM over tree implementation for misc. dataset.
4. "4_NN.piynb" jupytor notebook contains the neural network implementation for misc. dataset.

You can find the discussion and the results in Report.pdf

In order to reproduce the results:
A. Copy and paste all the datasets in the same directory.
B. Execute cells from the beginning to see the results for each section.
Results are already displayed in each section after correspongding cells.
